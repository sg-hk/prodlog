This is a [tatsumato](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tatsumato) inspired CLI productivity tool. It's essentially a glorified pomodoro timer. Further features will be added as the project goes on (database query tool, statistics, ...)

Note that it is tightly integrated with my current setup and requires: Hyprland, Eww, mpv, ... to run as intended.
