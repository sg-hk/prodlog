This is a [tatsumato](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tatsumato) inspired CLI productivity tool. It's essentially a glorified pomodoro timer. Further features will be added as the project goes on (database query tool, statistics, ...)

Note that it assumes a Unix architecture (/usr/bin, /usr/share folders) and Hyprland as compositor (hyprctl is the notification dispatcher). MPV is another dependency.
